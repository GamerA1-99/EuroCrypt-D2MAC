# The Analogue Satellite & TV Crypto
Collections of various analogue satellite & tv crypto files and software for various systems like VideoCrypt I & II, EuroCrypt M, S, S2, 3DES and Syster Nagravision. All of this is saved and indexed from different archived webpages, forums, file servers and from personal archive from the analogue satellite and TV era from the 1990s-2006.

This is intended to use with fsphill's HackTV: https://github.com/fsphil/hacktv 

or with steeviebops HackTV GUI: https://github.com/steeviebops/jhacktv-gui

in combination with Captain Jack's HackTV fork of encryption system EuroCrypt: https://github.com/captainjack64/hacktv

DISCLAIMER:

This is only for hobby and educational use and cannot be used for todays digital broadcasting (DVB-S/DVB-S2) since nothing is broadcasted with the mentioned analogue encryptions today and it is analogue systems and cannot be use for modern encryption systems either, this is because none of this systems havn't been updated nor used since 2010 and been abnonded since. These files and programs can however be stil used for projects like for exsample: HackTV's encryption and receviers connected to the HackTV system.
